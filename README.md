# 🧠 AI Portfolio by Samrin Baig

Welcome to my AI portfolio! This repository showcases a set of hands-on, end-to-end projects where I’ve applied large language models, fine-tuning techniques, and vector search to solve real-world problems. Each project is implemented in a clear and reproducible way using Python and Jupyter notebooks.
